📜 Custom Licensing Terms – Effective June 12, 2025
This repository (trashbus99/profork) contains scripts, integrations, and assets authored and maintained by Cliffy (trashbus99 / suki-san). It builds upon and replaces prior work found in uureel/batocera.pro.

✅ GPLv3 Licensed Scripts (By Definition)
The following remain fully licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3):

Scripts originally created or modified by uureel

Jointly authored works where Cliffy was not the sole contributor

Scripts where valid attribution metadata remains intact and clearly traceable

These may continue to be reused under GPLv3 so long as all license requirements are followed, including:

✅ Visible author attribution (not just hidden in commit logs)

✅ License notices preserved

✅ Modifications clearly marked

⚖️ Grandfathered “Friendly Forks” – Still Licensed
Any forks or mirrors of uureel/batocera.pro or trashbus99/profork created before June 11, 2025, are grandfathered in under GPLv3 provided they:

Preserve original commit metadata, or

Include explicit visible attribution to Cliffy or trashbus99 in the README or file headers

These forks are not considered in violation as long as credit is preserved and no misrepresentation occurs.

🚫 All New Forks or Rehosts Are Banned
As of June 11, 2025, no new forks, mirrors, or derivative repositories are permitted without explicit written permission.

The following are now strictly prohibited, regardless of the GPLv3 terms:

❌ Forking or rehosting any script authored solely by Cliffy

❌ Repackaging or embedding this code into overlays or external tools

❌ Distributing modified versions in public without permission

All newly created forks, copies, or redistributions after this date automatically forfeit any rights to reuse or distribute the affected scripts.

❌ GPLv3 Termination – No Attribution, No Rights
The GPLv3 license is considered terminated for any script that was:

✅ Authored or significantly modified solely by Cliffy

❌ Reused or distributed without proper attribution

❌ Forked or copied into public repositories without preserving metadata

These works are now protected under full copyright.

You may read and execute them locally, but you may not:

❌ Rehost or fork these files

❌ Integrate them into other public repositories

❌ Modify and distribute derivative versions

🛑 Explicit Violator Notice
The following repositories and users are in direct violation of these terms due to unauthorized use of code authored solely by Cliffy, stripped of attribution:

batocera-unofficial-addons

DTJW92 and related forks

Any other rehosts or scripts falsely claiming authorship or omitting source attribution

These parties have no valid license to use, modify, or distribute affected code and are required to cease distribution immediately.

📢 Attribution Is Required Under GPLv3 — Even for Single Files
From GPLv3 Section 5:
“You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that you distribute, all copyright notices of the authors…”

This includes:

GitHub repo ownership and identity

Commit history and repository context

README references or visible metadata

From the FSF:
"Even if no explicit copyright notice appears in the files, the original author still holds the copyright by default."
— GNU GPL FAQ – Free Software Foundation

🚫 Removing all traceable attribution — even from a single Bash script — constitutes a violation and automatically terminates your license under Section 8.

🔒 Execution-Only Clause for All Users
You may:

✅ Clone and execute these scripts for personal or private use

✅ Modify them locally for non-public/private configurations

You may not:

❌ Rehost any part of this repository

❌ Upload modified or repackaged versions

❌ Integrate this code into overlays, distributions, or public forks

🧠 Summary
This is free software — not attribution-free software.

🚫 If you erase the author, you erase your license.
Respect the code. Respect the terms. Respect the source.
